This is a php based web-site

It aimes to be as modular as possible.

So the general task this site aimes is
presenting a way that you can edit things in you userdirectory database, officily there will be just ldap support, but because of the abstraction of the userdirectory every directory will be possible.


==Terminology of words==

- Workflow:
   The site is workflowbased, the workflow can be controlled with the calls workflow_continue(symbol) and workflow_end()
   workflow_end will reload the site

- Instance:
   A instance is like a theme render implementation here, it renders the complete site. You can easily replace the current instance by just changing the key in the config.

- Configuration:
   A settings.ini file in the config directory.
   instance is the instance which will be loaded.
   loginservice is the loginservice which will be used.
   The other bits are there for ldap auth.

- Screen configuration:
   The configuration file screen_config.php should implement a class called Maschine, the class should act like a state maschine. For more information read the comments in the abstract class.

- Screen:
   A little module in laedit which renders a site with possible buttons which are controlling the workflow

==Instance==

A instance has to look like that:

instance/<yourname>/Theme.php
                   /js/..
                   /css/..

All js and css files will be printed into the header of the page.
